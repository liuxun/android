Getting Started

To get started with Android/GAOSP/CyanogenMod, you'll need to get familiar with Git and Repo.

To initialize your local repository using the GAOSP trees, use a command like this:

repo init -u git://github.com/liuxun/android.git

Then to sync up:

repo sync

Please see the GAOSP Wiki for building instructions.
